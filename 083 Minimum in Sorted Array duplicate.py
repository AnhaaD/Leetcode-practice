"""
If the rotated sorted array could contain duplicates? Is your algorithm still O(log n) in

runtime complexity?

Solution:

For case where AL == AM == AR, the minimum could be on AMâ€™s left or right side (eg,

[1, 1, 1, 0, 1] or [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]). In this case, we could not discard either subarrays and

therefore such worst case degenerates to the order of O(n).
